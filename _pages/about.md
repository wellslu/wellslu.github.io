I am a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)**, advised by Prof. Peng Li. Currently, I am also a Research Intern at **Cornell University**, working with Prof. Saikat Dutta.

My research interests lie in **Systems for ML**, with a primary focus on enhancing the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Previously, I worked as an AI Engineer at **Merkle** and **Open AI Fab**, where I developed efficient computer vision models and MLOps pipeline for real-world applications. 

**I am currently applying for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026.**
