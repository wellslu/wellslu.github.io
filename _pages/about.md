[cite_start]I am a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)**[cite: 6], advised by Prof. Peng Li. [cite_start]Currently, I am also a Research Intern at **Cornell University**, working with Prof. Saikat Dutta[cite: 14, 16].

[cite_start]My research interests lie in **Efficient Machine Learning** and **Systems for ML**, with a primary focus on enhancing the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**[cite: 4]. [cite_start]I enjoy bridging the gap between algorithm design and hardware efficiency, as demonstrated by my experience in optimizing inference on edge devices[cite: 36, 45].

[cite_start]Previously, I worked as an AI Engineer at **Kipt** and **Open AI Fab**, where I developed efficient computer vision models for real-world applications[cite: 29, 33]. [cite_start]I hold a B.S. in Data Science from Soochow University[cite: 8].

**I am currently applying for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026.**
